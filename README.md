# 🎮 Quiz Mini Game  

Everyone’s building AI copilots and billion-dollar apps…  
Meanwhile I’m over here bringing my **rusty Python skills back to life** with a tiny quiz game. 😅  

## 📌 About  
This is a Day 16 project from the Udemy course:  
**[100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/)** by Dr. Angela Yu.  

It’s a simple command-line quiz that:  
- Asks True/False questions  
- Tracks your score  
- Reminds me why I actually enjoy writing code myself  

## 🛠️ What I’m practicing  
- Object-Oriented Programming (classes, methods, attributes)  
- Splitting logic across multiple files  
- Actually typing code instead of letting AI do it all  

## 📸 Sample run  
```text
Q1: The sky is blue? (True/False): True
You got it right! Your current score is: 1/1
...
You completed the Quiz! Final score: 7/10
```

## 🙃 Final note
Not flashy, not AI-powered — but a small step in refreshing my Python muscles.
